# categorize-product
## Objective
- Welcome to the NLP-Based Product Categorization project! The primary goal of this GitHub repository is to provide a codebase for categorizing products using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project aims to leverage the power of language models to automatically assign products to one of four categories: "Book," "Electronic," "Household," and "Clothing & Accessories."

## Key Features
1. NLP for Product Categorization
The heart of the project lies in the application of NLP methods to analyze product descriptions and intelligently classify them into specific categories. This is achieved through the use of advanced language models that understand the nuances of product-related text.

2. Product Categories
The model is trained to recognize and categorize products into the following classes:
- Book
- Electronic
- Household
- Clothing & Accessories: Apparel, fashion items, and related accessories.
  
3. Data Source
- The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/ecommerce-text-classification. This dataset serves as the foundation for training the NLP model, providing a diverse range of product descriptions across different categories.

## Usage
To use the code for product categorization, follow the instructions provided in the project documentation. This includes data preprocessing, model training, and testing. The NLP model is designed to be adaptable, allowing users to fine-tune parameters or extend the functionality for different datasets or specific business needs.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are highly encouraged. Whether you want to enhance the model's accuracy, add support for additional categories, or improve the code structure, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaboration is key to making the product categorization model more robust and versatile.
